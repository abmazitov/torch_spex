# torch_spex
This is a small library that computes spherical expansions in Pytorch.
Compared to other implementations, it offers backpropagation and GPU support.

Dependencies:
numpy, torch, ase, equistore, scipy

The examples folder contains a BPNN built using this spherical 
expansion code. This NN achieves decent accuracy on methane and rMD17.
